# Depth Estimation using Stereo Camera
 This repository contains code to find disparity and depth map of two image sequences of a given subject by leveraging the concepts of epipolar geometry, Fundamental Matrix, Essential Matrix and its decomposition to get Rotation and Translation matrices, epipolar lines, rectification correspondence using SSD, and triangulation.
